  <title>Q2 - Cache clearing</title>

  The Browser Cache is simply a local place on your computer to store data from webpages that is often repetitive -
  it would be faster for your computer to show a copy of the facebook banner on the top of every page, than to download it from the internet
  every single time you navigate around the site. As long as the same items are displayed, it doesn't need to download them again.
  Your computer's cache is a finite amount of room that eventually fills up with cached webpages depending on how many you visit. Once the cache
  is full, it starts replacing old pages you don't visit with the new ones. It is not often explained well how webpages could break, but occasionally
  the formatting begins to get wonky. If you ever have trouble loading a webpage or it has difficulty displaying correctly on your computer, clearing the
  cache/cookies/userdata on your web browser will help it display properly again. Those old downloaded pages are gone, so every site you visit will be
  a fresh download from the internet. Cookies specifically can cause this issue. Sometimes the personal data that cookies hold (so it can remember
  your amazon shopping cart, address, login info or your identity/email in the case of MailChimp) can conflict with the cache. These cookies determine
  how mail chimp works. Cache and Cookies cleared = new login attempt, MailChimp asks for your email. Now it stores that data and remembers who you are
  everytime you visit the website. If you clear your cache/cookies, now that saved data is gone. Revisit q2, and MailChimp again asks for your email. That
  is how the browser cache and cookies work. It's also a good idea to clear cookies time to time for privacy reasons.
